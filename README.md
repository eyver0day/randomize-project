**1️⃣ Why does the application not open when I double-click the .exe file?**<br>
If the application does not launch, try running it from the command line to check for potential errors:

`randomize.exe`

If there are missing dependencies, ensure all required files are present.

**2️⃣ Can I use my own first name and last name dictionaries?**<br>
Yes! The application allows importing custom dictionaries for first and last names. Simply prepare a .txt file where each name is on a new line, and import it using the GUI.

Yes. You can select a location on the map by double-clicking. The address will be automatically retrieved.
